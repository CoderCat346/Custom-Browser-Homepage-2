## 📥 How to Use? 

### 🌐 Option 1: Use the Deployed Version (Easiest) 😊

No setup or downloads needed — just use a simple extension and a web link.

#### 👉 Steps:

1. **Install the extension**:

   * **Chrome / Brave / Edge**: [Override Chrome's New Tab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/override-chromes-new-tab/blipilanfdpkfifjekjokjahpjnngifa)
   * **Firefox**: [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)

2. In the extension settings, set this as your new tab page:

   ```
   https://home346.netlify.app
   ```

That’s it! Every new tab will now open with this custom homepage. 🎉

### 💾 Option 2: Use It Offline (From Your Device) 💻

Want full privacy or offline access? Run the homepage right from your computer.

#### 👉 Steps:

1. **Download the files**:

   * [Download ZIP](https://github.com/CoderCat346/Custom-Browser-Homepage-2/releases)
   * *or* clone it with Git:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/CoderCat346/Custom-Browser-Homepage-2.git
     ```

2. Find the `index.html` file you downloaded.

3. In the same browser extension, set your new tab URL to:

   ```
   file:///full/path/to/index.html
   ```

> ⚠️ Some extensions need permission to access local files. Check the extension settings if it doesn't load.

### 📱 Mobile Users (Bonus Tip)

Mobile browsers don’t support new tab extensions. But you can still get quick access:

1. Open [Homepage URL](https://home346.netlify.app) in your browser on your phone
2. Tap **... → Add to Home Screen**
3. Now it opens like an app — one tap from your phone’s home screen!
